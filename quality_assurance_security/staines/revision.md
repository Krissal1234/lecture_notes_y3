first question is about consolidation

- basic about ISO certification
- what are the main reasons for ISO certifications - for large organisations

the models in IS quality
- why do we use models - used for representation
- a model is not just composed of a diagram, it has a notaion,  amodel can also be a sequece of steps, to find a precise way of doing things - the models give us an indication on how to do things

corrective models and preventive models
- corrective model
- preventive model
	- how to plan for those fail safes

something small about process improvement


difference between ticket and ISO
- TickIT is smaller, used in the uk mainly, ISO is too cumbersome, and ISO needs re certification
- BS is the former version of ISO


there are various processes you  can use to implement software
does a process lifecycle nessesary mean it will give us a product? No, its not a guarantee becuasee there could be mistakes in the requirements

question 2
- SERIM entire question
- advantages and disadvantages
- why would we need to use SERIM
- we do not have possible perfect models
- the more you use SERIM the less mistakes there will be, training makes perfect, through repetition you get to know how to fine tune it how to apply it better
- Small part on CML
	capability mature model
	-when you first setup a software company there isn't the experience yet
	- The team would learn during the process, when the team learn how to learn better they can produce better quality
	a process that is more repeatable has higher quality
question 3
does higher quality cost more or less
something about high IT quality
some things about the delivery process
how COTS could help -stuff like that
