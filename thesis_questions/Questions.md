ask to review, removing one of the accellerometer approaches, should i still keep the two in the intro of accellerometer approach or should i remove that too?

Computer vision approachess, i dont mention accuracies of first paper, is taht fine?

removed normalisation from lit review

in implementaiton, augmentation section, i said experiments revealed that rotations didndt do so well, do i need another section in the evaluation testing this?

Ask, should i use VGG-BILSTM with 88% but weird training, weird loss graphs, or use 80% with nice training loss graphs

i have adam vs SGD optimiser however,, the best models dont have good looking training like the one showed in the evaluation, should i just switch out the SGD picture with one of the newer models (that looks good)

maybe take a look at training history, see if we can come up with things to say for the models

figure out which models to use to evaluate effect on feature extraction
- also what do i do about pca when testing:
	- Since i have three main variables: pca, feature extraction, augmentation, 

should i have a limitations section
