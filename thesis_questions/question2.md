Should i include chens results in the appendix and refer to them?

since i've used dimensionality reduction and optical flow should i include refrences in the lit revies

should i include ROC curves

what works should i evaluate agains in the comparative analysis, so far i have done only chen, but should i include Shapee (lit review) or maybe oraszo (methoddology in adapted models (do i remove this?))


should i include model summaries in appendix?

what do i put in appendix a and what in b?

go over evaluation and any modifications i should make

-----------
I have this in my intro
- This task poses significant challenges, due to diverse camera angles, lighting conditions and complex skateboard movements. However, this research aims to overcome these challenges and create a robust and accurate tool that can  reliably classify skateboard tricks from video.
	- should i reference this in my limitation? Mentioning that I could not account for these challenges do to the lack of data

pre pca use default parameters
real time applications paper

comparative analysis 
compare training times 
mention shapiee compare with him

move pca and optical flow to background
