lerping
- important topic - will appear in more tahn one question
- lerping and animation - question
- animations but also include lerping - anothe question

linear interpolation is lerping - page 52
- something we can interpret for a current frame
- you have a parameter t goiing from 0 to 1

one of the techniques that waas used instead of lerping is splines - check that out
you have points and you try to make a curve, you approximate 



sample ofr polyray animation - need to know how to create a simple polyray animation - we will need to write code
- i think lerping example


anti anliasing - averaging out values of pixel to thy to create a smoother effect, makes images look better
- to render with anti alisasing you have to calculate these averaages, which may be slower however with todays compterers it is not an issue
- this works with coloured pixels also


Rendering Equation

illumination equation

lambertian reflection
specular reflection
- need to be aware of these also in terms of makng an animation, e.g. how to set your object in daz studio, understand the concepts, tehre will be a scenario where you will have to make an animation, and you  need to explain tnese different reflections and how to get everything together and put them together in the coreecty way

striped textures are not so important

fixing clothes issues is not important this year


Light models and ambietn light and the ambient reflection coeficcient
ambient light

lighting model equation is imortant - illumination equation - the one reflectin ambient light not necessarliy kajia

The affect of light on an object in 3d, e.g. raking light

Ligth area and a shadow area

core shadow imp, the shadow that defines the form
cast shadow


light models
- e.g. indoor scene you shouldnt use distant light, but other types of lights for indoor scene
- out door scene you go for distance lights



### L- grammers
- need to revise
we have an example with production rules and work out generations
the first genration is always the letter A or B
have to represent it graphically too

first genration can be a straight line

enhancements, different branching angles for different depth branches
terminal nodes drawing leaves or flowers

L grammers a question on its own


composition, we mentioned composition, where you have basically a concept you are trying to express, basically there are things you can do, like having important shapes, utilisnig the 2/3 rds princple of photography

composition, can have a purpose
placement, how elements in an image are arranged


story boards
birds eye and worms eeye wnot be asked

we need to revise also the organisational process of making an animation
- defined by its storyboard, by a route sheet describine each scene and the people responsible for producing the scenents variossu aspects and by the exposure sheet, whicch is an immensely detailed description of the animation


Daz studio workflow
- should know the steps and how to apply it to an animation, 
- we migth find a way to apply this to one of the question, may be applicable - hwoever the question won be specifically asking for this


the exposure sheet

human inbetweener, can distinguish circumstances of an object being interpolated (e.g. is a ball falling or just rolling down)



### Vertex and edge based boudnary models - another question
- practical example
- need to know euler poincare formaula, and know how to confirm if a polyhedron is homo...
- not sufficient ofr all objects

will be given a shape and we have to worksout hte vertex list, edge list, face list (face list has edge numbers)

to seee if its right, you iunderly the numbers, right hand side is underlye


mentione opacity maps in daz studio -  a definition
- opacity map more imporatnt than displacement

wont be asked on handed coordination systems
