Concept drift means that the statistical properties of the target variable, which the model is trying to predict, change over time in unforseen ways
- This causes problems becuase the predictions become less accurate as time passes
The term concept refers to the quantitiy to be predicted
- More generally it can also refer to other phenoment of interest besides the target concept such as input

There are many tests that can be used to detect concept drift in data
- Dickey fuller test
- moving window ID3

If there is concept drift you must then be careful when choosing the training strategy


### AI singularity
- This is a hypothical future point in time at which AI technological growth becomes uncrontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unfathomable changes to human civilisation

The first use of the concept of a singularity in teh technological context was John Von Neuman

### AI in fintech
Artificial Intelligence (AI), as you know, is an umbrella term for a host of different technologies including machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP).
- AI holds many promises in banking and finance. Analysts now estimate that AI could save the industryÂ more than US$1 trillion by 2030.
The main problem is that the majority of the savings will be salaries. This will result in significant shifts in employment in business and finance


AI is currently exploding in business and finance
many analysts are concerned about the effect this will have on jobs
- Many degrees now include modules on Big data, AI and ML


- **Machine Learning** allows computers to process more data than a human ever could, and then using that data to teach itself by spotting patterns, machine learning makes it possible to draw insights that previously would have remained undiscovered.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP),** which refers to the ability of technology to use human communication, naturally spoken or written, as an input that prompts computer activity.
- **Natural Language Generation (NLG**) refers to the ability for technology to produce human quality prose. It sorts through large amounts of available data to produce a human-sounding response. NLG can take the form of speech, or of a multipage report summarizing financial results


Benefits of AI in fintech
- Reduced costs and Errors
	- By shifting tasks from humans to AI, speeding up response time and saving time by preparing reports
	- Bots to carry out repetitive tasks
- Risk mitigation
	-  Reducing financial risk through improved loan underwriting through machine learning, improved financial crime risk with advanced fraud detection, improved financial crime
- Increased Revenue, improved employee effectiveness and enhanced customer experience
	- by targetd emails and other offers, the use of speech analytics to quickly identify cases needing human attention by allowing employees to focus on highest value tasks
