what should you do when you have strategic interaction
- sometimes the best thing to do is counterinuitive

game theory is the study of how to mathematically determine the best strategy for given conditions in order to optimise the outcome 

Game theory studies the ways in which strategic interactions among rational players producce outcomes with respect to the players preferences

It helps people to decide if its a good idea to open a new store, to invest in a certain stock, if they should cut down their prices

nash equilibrium is the best move we can do
- The nash equilibrium tells you that if you play the nash equilibria infinitely many time then you should not lose


Bazeman auction
- Baseman proposed a auction of a 100 dollar bill
- the highest biddder would get the 100
- he added a twist, the person bidd second highest also had to pay is bid and get nothing
	- price went up to 465



Finding Nash equilibria is not always straight-forward
- recursive thinking is a problem in many games


The two games are often thought in game theory
- Guess 2/3 of the average
- Keynes Beauty contest game

formally what is a game?
- A game consist of the following elements
	- players - Who participates
	- strategies - what can each player do
	- payoff - the outcome of the game
	- knowledge - how does the game work

A strategy $s_j$ is a complete contingency plan that defines which actions player $j$ may take for all possible states of the game


What is a strategy?
A strategy is a course of action to a player. A game typically has many strategies

Payoffs are the final returns of the players at the conclusion of the game
payoffs are usually measured 


Nash Equilibrium
- A pair of strategies $(a^*,b^*)$ in a two player game such that $a^*$ is an optimal strategy for A against $b^*$ and $b^*$ is an optimal strategy for B against $a^*$
	- 

Rules
1. There are a finite number of players
2. the list of finite number of possible courses of action is available to each of the players
3. Each player ahs the knowledge of alternatives
4. Each player is associate d with an outcome
5. contiunuse...


Zero sum games - e.g. tic tac to

nash equilibrium is

nash equilibrium is hard it is NP Hard problem, especially in mixed problems

Applications of Game Theory

- business
- finance
- politics
- game playing
- market trading


there is no pure nash equilibrium to rock paper scisors


Banks dilemma
- We have fintech and we have the banks
- should the banks and new fintech startups cooperate or not
- At a theoretical viewpoint the nash equilibrium is to cooperate
	- it is because humans dont use mathematics but they use emotions
