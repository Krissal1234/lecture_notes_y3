Financial markets

A market is a place where traders gather to trade instruments

Basic functions:
- To bring buyeres and sellers together -- has change little over time, but the market faccility withn which trading takes place has been greatly influence by tech
- The market may consist in a physical trading floor, or it may be an electronic system in which traders can easily communicate with each other

Market microstructure examines organised trading in instruments. Instruments include common stocks, preferred stocks, bonds, convertible bonds, warrants, options, furture contracts, forward contracts etc ..

In a trading market, assets are not transformed (as they are by banks that transform deposits into loans) but they are simply transferred from one investor to another


#### Market Microstructure and Trading

Trading is a search problem. Buyers must find sellers, and sellers must fund buyers

- Every trader wants to trade at a good price
	- Sellers seek buyers willing to pay high prices
	- Buyers seek sellers willing to sell at low prices
	- Traders must also find traders who are willing to trade quantities, or sizes they desire

Stocks  represent only about 20% of the capital wealth of the US. Most of the wealth is in real estate, which rarely trades

#### Players
- Brokers trade on behalf of their clients
- investment sponsors - pention funds, mutual funds, trusts and foundations that invest money
- investment sponsors employ investment advisors to manager their funds
- investment advisers employ traders to implement their strategies and these traders are called buy side traders
- The beneficiaries ultimately benefit from the funds that investment sponsors hold
- Dealer is a person who will buy and sell securities on their account


- Traders have **long positions** when they own something. Traders with long positions profit when prices rise. They try to buy low and sell high.

- Traders have **short positions** when they have sold something that they do not own. Traders with short positions hope that prices will fall so that they can repurchase at a lower price. When they repurchase, they cover their positions. Short sellers profit when they sell high and buy low.



Buy side: consists of traders who buy exchange services. Liquidity is the most important of these services. Liquidity is the ability to trade when you want to trade

Sell side: refers to the part of the industry that is involve in the creation, promotion and sale of stocks, bonds and other financial instruments. Sell side individuals and firms work to create and service products that are made available to the buy side of the industry. the sell side provide the liquidity

### Speculative Trading
From a Machine learning perspective, our interest is mostly in speculative trading

Harris (2002) defines speculators as traders who trade to profit from information and predictions about future prices
- This also depends on the accuracy of this information

This makes technical analysis a more adequate tool and rests on the underlying assumption that prices
move in trends (hence asserting price momentum). 
- Typically, technical traders apply a set of technical indicators, which normally consist in an arsenal of statistical measures and charts (or machine learning algorithms), to assist with the analysis of the noisy price time series and with the prediction of short-termmarket moves.

### Types of Trading sessions

**continuous markets:** traders may trade anytime the market is open
**call markets:** all traders trade at the same time when the market is called. The market may call all securities simulataneously or it may call the securities one at a time, in rotation

Markets utilize time matching orders with order precedence rules.

The main advantage of **continuous trading** is that it allows traders to attempt to
arrange their trades whenever they want.

The main advantage of **call markets** is that they focus the attention of all traders
interested in a given instrument at the same time and place.


Orders
- Orders are instructions that traders give to brokers and exchanges which arrange their trades

### Market orders

These are orders that are traded at the best price currently available in the market

you pay the bid/ask price spread in a round trip

Market orders are characterised by execution price uncertainty

### Limit Orders

A limit order is an instruction to trade at the best price available, but only if it is no worse than the limit price specified by the trader

Buy orders: the trade price must be at or below the limit price 
sell orders: the trade price must be above the limit price

## The Trading Process

Johnsonn(2010) divides the trading process into three stages:
(i) Price formation
(ii) price discovery and trade execution
(iii) reporting, clearing and settlement


#### Price Formation

Price formation is the process through which the price of an asset is determined - evaluating a fair price of something

Since different investors tend to have different views in terms of asset valuation, price formation is the result of supply and demand conditions


#### Price discovery
price discovery happens when supply and demand requirements intersect, hence determining the price of an asset

The constant tension between butyesr and sellers dictates the dynamic movement of market prices



## Technical Analysis

Different tools
- Technical analysts believe that a stock price includes enough information to not need to analyse a company's financial statements
- They focus on the stock chart for hints into where the price may be headed

![[Pasted image 20240516170953.png]]

Chartist: these people analyse price charts only
technical analysts: study technical indicators derived from price changes in addition to price charts.

Technical analysts  examine the price action of the financial markets instead of the fundamental factors that effect market prices
- Technicians believe that even if all relevant information of a particular market or stock was available, you could not predict a precise market "response" to that information








Volatility
- It does not measure the direction of price changes but merely their dispersion
- Two instruments with different volatilities may have the same expected return but the one with higher volatility will have large swingsg in values over a given period of time
